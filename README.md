# Raytracer.

Implementation of a simple raytracing algorithm with the following characteristics:
  1. Loading of scene files.
  2. Rendering of scene using spheres.
  3. Shading of spheres with diffuse and specular illumination.
  4. Reflections.

## Environments.
For the time being the algorithm is working only in Linux.
In order to execute run ```./run.sh``` at the project root.

## Keyboard configuration.
The only possible interaction is to terminate the program, to do so press the ESC key.
